# ðŸŒ¿ Smart Farming Analytics â€“ A Data Engineering & Analytics Project

A data-focused project that simulates and analyzes farm sensor data to derive insights for smarter irrigation decisions â€” combining time-series analysis, data pipeline design, and visualization.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

The goal of this project is to simulate a smart farm environment and build an end-to-end data analytics pipeline to:

- Collect (simulate) real-time agricultural sensor data (e.g., soil moisture, temperature)
- Store and manage structured data efficiently
- Analyze patterns in time-series data to detect water stress
- Generate irrigation recommendations based on rule-based logic or simple predictive models
- Present insights in a clear, visual dashboard/report

---

## ðŸ’¡ What This Project Demonstrates

- Data engineering fundamentals: structured data pipelines, transformations, storage
- Time-series analytics and anomaly detection
- Use of Python-based analytics stack (Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib)
- Dashboarding or reporting (Streamlit or Jupyter)
- Real-world context in agri-tech / environmental analytics
