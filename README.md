# ðŸŒ¿ Smart Farming Analytics â€“ A Data Engineering & Analytics Project

A data-focused project that collects and analyzes farm sensor data from an publically available API to derive insights for smarter irrigation decisions â€” combining time-series analysis, data pipeline design, and visualization.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

The goal of this project is to simulate a smart farm environment and build an end-to-end data analytics pipeline to:

- Collect real-time agricultural sensor data (e.g., soil moisture, soil temperature, soil salinity, Location meta data)
- Store and manage structured data efficiently
- Analyze patterns in time-series data to detect water stress
- Generate irrigation recommendations based on rule-based logic or simple predictive models
- Present insights in a clear, visual dashboard/report

---

## ðŸ’¡ What This Project Demonstrates

- Data engineering fundamentals: structured data pipelines, transformations, storage
- Time-series analytics and anomaly detection
- Use of Python-based analytics stack (Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib)
- Dashboarding or reporting (Streamlit or Jupyter)
- Real-world context in agri-tech / environmental analytics

## About the Data :: Why Simulated Sensor Data?

The dataset contains historical soil sensor readings (updated hourly) collected from public parks across the City of Melbourne. Sensors capture multiple environmental metrics like soil moisture, temperature, and salinity at varying depths. While the data originates from an urban setting, it was repurposed to mimic agricultural conditions for demonstrating data engineering and analytics capabilities.
